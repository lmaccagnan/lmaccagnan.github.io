### Motivation
Having spent over two decades in public K-12 education, as well as developing expertise in other areas, I am now exploring the vast possibilities within the fields of data science and research. This project will help me identify opportunities that integrate my diverse background with my interests in data and research. Additionally, I seek to understand and emphasize transferable skills that enhance my candidacy for roles in this new field.
### Goals
-	Identify specific career paths within data science and/or research.
-	Create a list of target companies offering roles that match my career interests.

## Weekly updates
[Week 2](weeklyupdates.md)
**Week 2:** Last week, I focused on brainstorming project ideas to help me identify potential career paths and determine any additional training or qualifications I might need. My primary area of interest is data and research, but I’ve realized it is a broad field. As part of this process, I’ve been exploring how my formal education, background, and passions could intersect with a data-focused career. While the brainstorming was productive, I didn’t do as much documentation as I’d hoped, which is something I plan to improve.

This week, my goal is to narrow my focus further and identify a more specific direction for my efforts this semester. I also aim to outline key activities and milestones to guide my progress. One challenge I’ve encountered is recognizing gaps in my knowledge—there are career options and pathways I wasn’t previously aware of. Reading classmates’ introductions has already been helpful in highlighting opportunities I hadn’t considered.

Moving forward, I plan to adopt a structured brainstorming strategy that has worked well for me in the past. This involves writing down targeted questions and systematically documenting the answers I discover. By doing so, I hope to create a more organized and actionable foundation for my exploration.
