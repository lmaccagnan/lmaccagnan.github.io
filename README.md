## Final Project Report

### Introduction

The vision for this project was to prepare for a successful transition into a career in data science and/or research, aligning my professional goals with my passions and leveraging my 25-year background in public K-12 education and other professional experiences. My goals included identifying specific career paths, conducting informational interviews, and developing a strategic approach to career exploration that aligned my skills, passions, experiences, and personal goals. My intention was to not rush into a job search, but to explore the possibilities that exist.

### Background

This project was grounded in my desire to make a career change after spending over two decades in public K–12 education. I have always been drawn to data science, and this project gave me the opportunity to engage in a structured process to explore how my past experiences, values, and skills could be applied in ways that align with who I am at this point in my life. It helped me identify career possibilities that feel both engaging and authentic. In addition, the project gave me a chance to learn how to reach out and begin building a supportive professional network that may assist in my transition.

### Methodology, Materials and Methods

Based on a recommendation from one of my classmates, I began my exploration by reading *The 2-Hour Job Search* by Steve Dalton. The book provided a highly structured approach to identifying potential employers, finding and reaching out to contacts, and conducting interviews. In the book, Dalton included a section titled “Addressing the BIG Question – What Should I Do With My Life?” where he referenced an exercise from *Designing Your Life* by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans involving the creation of Odyssey Plans. That second book ended up becoming the real foundation for my learning during this class.

The activities in *Designing Your Life* helped me identify what I want from work within the broader context of what I want my life to look like at this point. It pushed me to reflect on different aspects of past jobs that had been especially engaging, helping me hone in on the kinds of work that are most satisfying for me. One of the key activities, the Odyssey Plan exercise, asked me to create three possible five-year plans. My plans included becoming a data scientist at a company, working as a data scientist within an organization focused on influencing policy, and starting my own business. The authors also outlined a process for conducting "prototyping" conversations and experiences—talking to people actually doing these kinds of roles—to better understand what the real-world work would be like and to see what I might actually enjoy.

Using strategies from both books, I began reaching out to people to set up interviews. I contacted people through LinkedIn and email, and I also used websites like Hunter.io to find email addresses when needed. Dr. Guinn was especially helpful in this process, sending along names of alumni and other professional contacts he was aware of. That turned out to be a great example of one of the benefits of this process—when people know specifically what you are looking for, they know how to help.

When conducting interviews, I chose not to take notes during the conversations in order to keep the dialogue more natural. Instead, immediately after each interview, I wrote down the key ideas, advice, and recommendations that had come up.

### Results

Throughout this project, I achieved the following:

- Read and applied insights from both *The 2-Hour Job Search* and *Designing Your Life*.
- Completed the recommended activities to clarify my values and priorities, as well as to imagine different career possibilities.
- Conducted research into the field of data science to narrow down specific types of data science jobs that align with my interests.
- Updated my LinkedIn and Handshake profiles, incorporating advice from Steve Dalton’s other book, *The Job Closer*.
- Created a curated list of target companies and professional contacts.
- Conducted several prototyping interviews to answer questions related to two of my Odyssey Plans. (I have not yet been able to connect with anyone working at a think tank.)
- Began working on developing a company name and researching domain registration as I continue to explore the entrepreneurial pathway.
- Started learning Power BI and am preparing to conduct data analysis around customer satisfaction in my current role as part of a prototyping experience.

### Discussion / Reflection

While I began this project with the goal of exploring new career possibilities, I initially approached it with a job-seeking mindset. Although finding a new role remains a long-term objective, I realized early on that now is the time to slow down and focus on exploration. This period marks a major life transition for me—retiring from a long-term career in education and stepping into a new phase as my children begin their own adult lives. With fewer constraints and more flexibility, I can take risks I might not have considered before. I also have a stronger understanding of what matters to me in a job: meaningful responsibilities, small collaborative teams, and flexible, remote-friendly environments. I'm particularly drawn to roles that allow me to influence systems—especially in policy, education, or health.

Through this process, I discovered that I’m most interested in application-focused data roles that use analysis to inform decisions and drive change. Positions like data analyst, business intelligence analyst, and data scientist feel like the right fit. My Odyssey Plans reflect three distinct paths: working in a data science role, focusing on policy impact, or launching my own business.

I’ve really enjoyed hearing people’s stories about the different stages of their careers and how they got to where they are today. In many cases, it was informal networks and relationships with colleagues that helped them make connections and step into new roles. One of my own conversations led me to identify a “promoter” within my current workplace—someone who’s become a supportive contact and is helping me explore opportunities to do business intelligence analysis within my organization. Reaching out and asking for help isn’t typically my style, but the format of these interviews has offered a more natural and authentic way to build relationships. I’ve especially appreciated having my Odyssey Plans as a guide for the conversations—it’s helped keep the focus on specific questions I need answered. For instance, one of my questions about starting a business was how to find customers, and that became part of the conversation I had with the entrepreneur I interviewed.

It feels a little unsettling to be writing a final report while still in the middle of the journey. But even without being “done,” I can confidently say that I met my goals. This exploration has truly been about opening the door to possibility and then asking questions that will help me make good decisions when the time comes. In many ways, it mirrors the data cycle—continually questioning, gathering, refining, and testing. While I don’t have all the answers yet, the prototyping conversations have helped me move forward with more clarity and confidence. At this stage of life, I’m embracing the chance to be intentional and thoughtful as I design what comes next.

### Conclusion

This project was exactly what I needed at this point in the program. I was initially nervous about proposing it, especially when comparing it to the more technical or service-oriented projects others proposed or completed in the past. But I’ve come to see the value in this kind of work. I believe this project can serve as a model for others who want to be more intentional about choosing a career path and who may need structure, guidance, and ideas to support that process. I look forward to continuing to learn from others while expanding my professional network beyond the spaces I typically operate in. I already have two additional interviews scheduled beyond the class deadline and plan to maintain a regular outreach routine to keep answering the questions that remain. As I move forward, I’ll begin engaging in prototyping experiences to get firsthand insight into roles I believe will be a good fit. One of those opportunities is already taking shape in my current job—something that wouldn’t have happened without the initial outreach this project encouraged me to make.
