## Weekly updates
Week 2: Last week, I focused on brainstorming project ideas to help me identify potential career paths and determine any additional training or qualifications I might need. My primary area of interest is data and research, but I’ve realized it is a broad field. As part of this process, I’ve been exploring how my formal education, background, and passions could intersect with a data-focused career. While the brainstorming was productive, I didn’t do as much documentation as I’d hoped, which is something I plan to improve.
This week, my goal is to narrow my focus further and identify a more specific direction for my efforts this semester. I also aim to outline key activities and milestones to guide my progress. One challenge I’ve encountered is recognizing gaps in my knowledge—there are career options and pathways I wasn’t previously aware of. Reading classmates’ introductions has already been helpful in highlighting opportunities I hadn’t considered.
Moving forward, I plan to adopt a structured brainstorming strategy that has worked well for me in the past. This involves writing down targeted questions and systematically documenting the answers I discover. By doing so, I hope to create a more organized and actionable foundation for my exploration.
