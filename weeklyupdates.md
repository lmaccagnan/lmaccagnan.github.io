### Weekly Updates

### Week 2:
Last week, I focused on brainstorming project ideas to help me identify potential career paths and determine any additional training or qualifications I might need. My primary area of interest is data and research, but I’ve realized it is a broad field. As part of this process, I’ve been exploring how my formal education, background, and passions could intersect with a data-focused career. While the brainstorming was productive, I didn’t do as much documentation as I’d hoped, which is something I plan to improve.

This week, my goal is to narrow my focus further and identify a more specific direction for my efforts this semester. I also aim to outline key activities and milestones to guide my progress. One challenge I’ve encountered is recognizing gaps in my knowledge—there are career options and pathways I wasn’t previously aware of. Reading classmates’ introductions has already been helpful in highlighting opportunities I hadn’t considered.

Moving forward, I plan to adopt a structured brainstorming strategy that has worked well for me in the past. This involves writing down targeted questions and systematically documenting the answers I discover. By doing so, I hope to create a more organized and actionable foundation for my exploration.

### Week 3:
Last week, I completed the research phase for my project ideas, attended office hours to discuss my plans in greater detail, and successfully wrote my project proposal. These efforts helped me solidify a clear vision and actionable steps for my project. I also made significant progress in documenting my brainstorming and research, which proved to be an effective strategy for organizing my thoughts. Additionally, connecting with others through office hours and Piazza was instrumental in refining my proposal and establishing a specific timeline for my goals.

This week, my primary focus is on finishing my website and reviewing the informational interviewing resources shared by colleagues. These resources will be key in preparing for the next phase of my project, where I aim to build connections and gather valuable insights from professionals in the field.

Currently, I do not have any blockers. In terms of process, I have found that writing things down and collaborating with others significantly enhances my productivity and clarity. I plan to continue using these strategies as I move forward, ensuring that I stay organized and on track with my objectives.

### Week 4:
Last week, I made significant progress by finalizing my website and reading The 2-Hour Job Search, which provided valuable insights into structuring an effective job search process.

This week, my focus has shifted to exploring career opportunities within the data science and research fields. I am researching different roles to gain a clearer understanding of their responsibilities, required qualifications, and how they align with my skills and experience. This will help refine my job search strategy and ensure I am targeting roles that best fit my strengths and career goals.

So far, I have not encountered any blockers. The process I’ve been following has been working well, though after reading The 2-Hour Job Search, I may need to adjust my future timeline. However, this is still to be determined as I continue refining my strategy.

### Week 5:
Last week, I focused on researching job titles within data science, starting with a broad perspective and then narrowing my focus to more specific applications. This helped me gain a better understanding of the diverse opportunities available within the field.  

This week, I am shifting my attention to understanding the context in which I want to work as a data scientist. Rather than just identifying job titles, I am focusing on the environments, industries, and types of organizations that align with my interests and skills. This will allow me to create a targeted list of employers for informational interviews, ensuring my networking efforts are intentional and aligned with my long-term career goals.  

One challenge I have encountered is getting distracted by job postings, even though I am not currently looking for a position. Since I still have two semesters left with a full course load, taking on a new job right now is not feasible. Additionally, I have realized that the range of data science roles is vast, and I need to spend more time clarifying the unique context in which I want to work. Recognizing this early was important, as it has allowed me to revise my approach.  

To stay focused on the bigger picture, I am adopting a design approach outlined in *Design Your Life* by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans. This framework will help me think more strategically about my career path, ensuring that my job search process is both structured and aligned with my personal and professional goals.

### Week 6:
Last week, I read Designing Your Life and completed the exercises in the book. One of the most impactful activities was creating Odyssey Plans—three different five-year career paths I could take. This exercise helped me visualize multiple possibilities for my future. Another key takeaway was refining my approach to informational interviews. While The 2-Hour Job Search focuses on networking to secure an internal advocate for job opportunities, Designing Your Life introduces "prototyping conversations," which are more about exploring roles and determining if they are the right fit. Given my current uncertainty and longer timeline for job applications, this approach makes more sense for me. The book also emphasizes prototyping experiences in different ways to test out potential career directions before committing fully.

Next week, I plan to explore LinkedIn more deeply—both to leverage its lifelong learning resources and to update my profile before actively building my network. I also want to familiarize myself with LinkedIn’s features to effectively find and connect with people.

I don’t have any blockers at this time. I recognized that my process was leading me slightly off track, but I now feel like I’m back on the right path.

### Week 7:
Last week, I focused on LinkedIn, both for its lifelong learning resources and for my project. I updated my profile, searched for and joined relevant groups, and explored different ways to find professionals for potential informational interviews. Additionally, I discovered Handshake through CU’s Career Services, which may also be a valuable resource for networking and job exploration.

Next week, I will finalize the protocol for my informational/prototype interviews and create a targeted list of people I want to reach out to. This will help streamline the process and ensure I have a clear approach before initiating conversations.

I don’t have any significant blockers, but I am facing a dilemma with my Handshake profile. The education section does not list my Education Specialist (EdS) degree in Administrative Leadership and Policy Studies as an option. Since it’s more advanced than a master’s but not a doctorate, I’m unsure how to accurately represent it within the platform’s forced-choice options.

The process and timeline I’ve set up are working well. As I begin scheduling informational interviews, I anticipate some scheduling challenges due to potential conflicts between my work availability and that of the professionals I’m reaching out to. I plan to remain as flexible as possible to accommodate different schedules.

### Week 8:
Last week, I compiled a list of companies that interest me. While this approach still aligns somewhat with a "find a job" mindset, it serves as a tool to identify people within these organizations whose roles intrigue me for prototyping interviews. I started by exploring different sectors based on my personal passions and past experiences, then listed relevant companies and organizations. I also began identifying potential interviewees and conducted my first prototyping interview.

Next week, I plan to expand both my company and interviewee lists. To do this, I will apply strategies from The 2-Hour Job Search, such as exploring related companies through the "People Also Viewed" section on LinkedIn and identifying organizations featured in articles that capture my interest. I will also leverage alumni connections and continue expanding my network through personal and professional contacts.

I do not have any blockers, but upon reflecting on last week's conversation, I realize I didn’t gain as much actionable insight as I had hoped. While I found the person's story compelling, I’m uncertain how to translate it into next steps. One initial thought is that the purpose may simply be to identify which aspects of their role resonate with me and warrant further exploration. Shifting from a job-seeker mindset to one of pure learning may be a challenge, but it’s something I need to reflect on further.

### Week 9:
Last week, I expanded my list of companies and individuals to connect with and refined my interview process. I revisited the three career plans I developed earlier, using them as a guide to identify relevant organizations and people. One area I’m exploring is leveraging data analysis to inform policy, which led me to a different set of companies and organizations. Another focus is the possibility of starting my own business, shaping my search through that lens.

Reflecting on my recent interview, I gained valuable insights into the person’s career path but didn’t dive deeply enough into the day-to-day realities of the role. I heard an inspiring story about using data to improve healthcare outcomes for children but didn’t probe into what that work looked like in practice. Given that this will be my “encore” career, I want to be intentional about the conditions in which I work, including work-life balance and collaboration dynamics. Understanding how collaboration functions within different organizations is particularly important to me.

Next week, I plan to expand my outreach efforts to schedule and conduct more interviews.

I don’t have any blockers at this time. Now that I have greater clarity on my interview protocol and desired outcomes, I feel confident that my process is on track.

### Week 10:
Last week, I reached out to several people to conduct interviews. I found it easier to connect with individuals I had some prior interaction with—even if it was just a brief meeting—than to reach out to complete strangers. While searching for potential connections on LinkedIn, I noticed that many people have their contact information hidden unless they are within my network.

So far, I have used LinkedIn messages to reach out and am awaiting several responses. To expand my outreach, I plan to use Hunter.io to find email addresses and connect with people directly via email.

Next week, I will continue reaching out and conducting interviews.

I do not have any unexpected blockers at this time. I anticipated that scheduling interviews might be challenging, but with spring break next week, I believe the additional flexibility will help mitigate delays in getting responses.

### Week 11:
Last week, I continued reaching out to individuals to request informational interviews. I updated my Handshake profile, reviewed resources from CU’s Career Office, and created a tracking system to monitor my outreach and interviews.

Next week, I plan to continue scheduling additional interviews.

Currently, I’m facing a challenge with receiving responses to my outreach. I’ve used both LinkedIn messages and direct emails, but my “cold” requests haven’t been effective, even with  CSPB alumni. When I do have a prior connection, I’ve been able to connect successfully. I understand that response rates are typically low, but I’ve been surprised at just how low they’ve been. I don’t expect immediate replies, but waiting without any response makes the process feel frustrating because I don’t want to lose time before the end of the semester.

As I reflect, I plan to revise the language in my emails, particularly the subject line, to make them more engaging. I also intend to increase the number of outreach attempts in the coming week.

### Week 12:
Last week , I continued reaching out to individuals to request informational interviews and have been experiencing greater success. I also began developing ideas for “prototyping experiences” within my current role and am currently awaiting approval to begin working with Power BI to explore data and create visualizations.

Next week, I have two interviews scheduled and plan to continue reaching out to additional individuals for informational conversations.

I am not facing barriers at this point. I recognize the semester is coming to end, but I will continue this outreach after this class. This process has proven to be valuable for my long-term growth, and I’m learning to release the pressure of needing to “finish” within a set timeframe.

As I reflect on this process in a general sense, I am excited to have the opportunity to talk to people and explore the unknown. I’ve rarely given myself the space to do this kind of exploratory work before, and I’m grateful for the chance to step into the unknown.

### Week 13:
Last week, I had several informational interviews that helped clarify some of the career paths I’m considering. One particularly insightful conversation was with someone who started and currently runs her own business—the first time I’ve spoken with an entrepreneur in this context. She introduced me to Lean Canvas, a one-page business modeling tool that helps structure and evaluate new ideas.

We also discussed the role of AI in data science, a topic that also came up in my conversation with Dr. Guinn. Both individuals emphasized how AI can handle routine tasks, allowing professionals to focus on more complex problems and projects that often get deprioritized. During my conversation with Dr. Guinn and others in office hours, I appreciated hearing perspectives on how AI-related coursework in our program connects to different career directions within data science.

Additionally, I made progress in my current role toward doing broader data analysis work. This will allow me to gain hands-on experience and identify what aspects of data work I find most engaging, as well as being exposed to additional tools.

Next week, I plan to continue following up on outreach and schedule new informational interviews. I’m particularly interested in exploring data analysis in the athletic performance space. My first bachelor’s degree was in Kinesiology, and I’ve always had a strong interest in human performance. I’m curious to see where the industry stands today and how data science is being applied.

I’ll also begin drafting my final project report.

I don’t have any blockers at this time. While there’s always room for refining my process, things are progressing well overall.
