### Weekly Updates

### Week 2:
Last week, I focused on brainstorming project ideas to help me identify potential career paths and determine any additional training or qualifications I might need. My primary area of interest is data and research, but I’ve realized it is a broad field. As part of this process, I’ve been exploring how my formal education, background, and passions could intersect with a data-focused career. While the brainstorming was productive, I didn’t do as much documentation as I’d hoped, which is something I plan to improve.

This week, my goal is to narrow my focus further and identify a more specific direction for my efforts this semester. I also aim to outline key activities and milestones to guide my progress. One challenge I’ve encountered is recognizing gaps in my knowledge—there are career options and pathways I wasn’t previously aware of. Reading classmates’ introductions has already been helpful in highlighting opportunities I hadn’t considered.

Moving forward, I plan to adopt a structured brainstorming strategy that has worked well for me in the past. This involves writing down targeted questions and systematically documenting the answers I discover. By doing so, I hope to create a more organized and actionable foundation for my exploration.

### Week 3:
Last week, I completed the research phase for my project ideas, attended office hours to discuss my plans in greater detail, and successfully wrote my project proposal. These efforts helped me solidify a clear vision and actionable steps for my project. I also made significant progress in documenting my brainstorming and research, which proved to be an effective strategy for organizing my thoughts. Additionally, connecting with others through office hours and Piazza was instrumental in refining my proposal and establishing a specific timeline for my goals.

This week, my primary focus is on finishing my website and reviewing the informational interviewing resources shared by colleagues. These resources will be key in preparing for the next phase of my project, where I aim to build connections and gather valuable insights from professionals in the field.

Currently, I do not have any blockers. In terms of process, I have found that writing things down and collaborating with others significantly enhances my productivity and clarity. I plan to continue using these strategies as I move forward, ensuring that I stay organized and on track with my objectives.

### Week 4:
Last week, I made significant progress by finalizing my website and reading The 2-Hour Job Search, which provided valuable insights into structuring an effective job search process.

This week, my focus has shifted to exploring career opportunities within the data science and research fields. I am researching different roles to gain a clearer understanding of their responsibilities, required qualifications, and how they align with my skills and experience. This will help refine my job search strategy and ensure I am targeting roles that best fit my strengths and career goals.

So far, I have not encountered any blockers. The process I’ve been following has been working well, though after reading The 2-Hour Job Search, I may need to adjust my future timeline. However, this is still to be determined as I continue refining my strategy.

### Week 5:
Last week, I focused on researching job titles within data science, starting with a broad perspective and then narrowing my focus to more specific applications. This helped me gain a better understanding of the diverse opportunities available within the field.  

This week, I am shifting my attention to understanding the context in which I want to work as a data scientist. Rather than just identifying job titles, I am focusing on the environments, industries, and types of organizations that align with my interests and skills. This will allow me to create a targeted list of employers for informational interviews, ensuring my networking efforts are intentional and aligned with my long-term career goals.  

One challenge I have encountered is getting distracted by job postings, even though I am not currently looking for a position. Since I still have two semesters left with a full course load, taking on a new job right now is not feasible. Additionally, I have realized that the range of data science roles is vast, and I need to spend more time clarifying the unique context in which I want to work. Recognizing this early was important, as it has allowed me to revise my approach.  

To stay focused on the bigger picture, I am adopting a design approach outlined in *Design Your Life* by Bill Burnett and Dave Evans. This framework will help me think more strategically about my career path, ensuring that my job search process is both structured and aligned with my personal and professional goals.

### Week 6:
Last week, I read Designing Your Life and completed the exercises in the book. One of the most impactful activities was creating Odyssey Plans—three different five-year career paths I could take. This exercise helped me visualize multiple possibilities for my future. Another key takeaway was refining my approach to informational interviews. While The 2-Hour Job Search focuses on networking to secure an internal advocate for job opportunities, Designing Your Life introduces "prototyping conversations," which are more about exploring roles and determining if they are the right fit. Given my current uncertainty and longer timeline for job applications, this approach makes more sense for me. The book also emphasizes prototyping experiences in different ways to test out potential career directions before committing fully.

Next week, I plan to explore LinkedIn more deeply—both to leverage its lifelong learning resources and to update my profile before actively building my network. I also want to familiarize myself with LinkedIn’s features to effectively find and connect with people.

I don’t have any blockers at this time. I recognized that my process was leading me slightly off track, but I now feel like I’m back on the right path.

### Week 7:
Last week, I focused on LinkedIn, both for its lifelong learning resources and for my project. I updated my profile, searched for and joined relevant groups, and explored different ways to find professionals for potential informational interviews. Additionally, I discovered Handshake through CU’s Career Services, which may also be a valuable resource for networking and job exploration.

Next week, I will finalize the protocol for my informational/prototype interviews and create a targeted list of people I want to reach out to. This will help streamline the process and ensure I have a clear approach before initiating conversations.

I don’t have any significant blockers, but I am facing a dilemma with my Handshake profile. The education section does not list my Education Specialist (EdS) degree in Administrative Leadership and Policy Studies as an option. Since it’s more advanced than a master’s but not a doctorate, I’m unsure how to accurately represent it within the platform’s forced-choice options.

The process and timeline I’ve set up are working well. As I begin scheduling informational interviews, I anticipate some scheduling challenges due to potential conflicts between my work availability and that of the professionals I’m reaching out to. I plan to remain as flexible as possible to accommodate different schedules.
