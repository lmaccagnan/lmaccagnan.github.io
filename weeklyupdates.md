### Weekly Updates

### Week 2:
Last week, I focused on brainstorming project ideas to help me identify potential career paths and determine any additional training or qualifications I might need. My primary area of interest is data and research, but I’ve realized it is a broad field. As part of this process, I’ve been exploring how my formal education, background, and passions could intersect with a data-focused career. While the brainstorming was productive, I didn’t do as much documentation as I’d hoped, which is something I plan to improve.

This week, my goal is to narrow my focus further and identify a more specific direction for my efforts this semester. I also aim to outline key activities and milestones to guide my progress. One challenge I’ve encountered is recognizing gaps in my knowledge—there are career options and pathways I wasn’t previously aware of. Reading classmates’ introductions has already been helpful in highlighting opportunities I hadn’t considered.

Moving forward, I plan to adopt a structured brainstorming strategy that has worked well for me in the past. This involves writing down targeted questions and systematically documenting the answers I discover. By doing so, I hope to create a more organized and actionable foundation for my exploration.

### Week 3:
Last week, I completed the research phase for my project ideas, attended office hours to discuss my plans in greater detail, and successfully wrote my project proposal. These efforts helped me solidify a clear vision and actionable steps for my project. I also made significant progress in documenting my brainstorming and research, which proved to be an effective strategy for organizing my thoughts. Additionally, connecting with others through office hours and Piazza was instrumental in refining my proposal and establishing a specific timeline for my goals.

This week, my primary focus is on finishing my website and reviewing the informational interviewing resources shared by colleagues. These resources will be key in preparing for the next phase of my project, where I aim to build connections and gather valuable insights from professionals in the field.

Currently, I do not have any blockers. In terms of process, I have found that writing things down and collaborating with others significantly enhances my productivity and clarity. I plan to continue using these strategies as I move forward, ensuring that I stay organized and on track with my objectives.

### Week 4:
Last week, I made significant progress by finalizing my website and reading The 2-Hour Job Search, which provided valuable insights into structuring an effective job search process.

This week, my focus has shifted to exploring career opportunities within the data science and research fields. I am researching different roles to gain a clearer understanding of their responsibilities, required qualifications, and how they align with my skills and experience. This will help refine my job search strategy and ensure I am targeting roles that best fit my strengths and career goals.

So far, I have not encountered any blockers. The process I’ve been following has been working well, though after reading The 2-Hour Job Search, I may need to adjust my future timeline. However, this is still to be determined as I continue refining my strategy.
